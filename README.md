# NoSoundAllowed

Project made in the Summer Innovation Week 2018, by CRITICAL Software.

The main goal is to monitor an open-space in an enterprise environment, with noise and temperature values in real-time.

Using the Thunderboard Sense 2 Silicon Labs (https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/thunderboard/thunderboard-sense-two-kit), that sends values to a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, that sends them to a Django Backend.

The backend saves the sensor values history and shows them in a dashboard.
